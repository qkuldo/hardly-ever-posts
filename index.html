  <details><summary>is this similar to anything?</summary><div style="padding-left: 20px;"><i>if you've visited this page's <a href="https://github.com/qkuldo/hardly-ever-posts">github repo</a>, you may have noticed the above exchange is actually an extended version of the README.md file(essentially the "about page" of code projects). I will make no further comments about this because i don't care.</i></div></details>

<h3>-~ About me ~-</h3>
<p>as the intermission you read(or didn't, i don't judge) said, i am qkuldo, and i am a programmer and student. <br>
i play many games on my Nintendo Switch, <br>
mostly cozy games, nintendo platformers and pokemon(i am indeed a big pokemon fan).<br>
if i put stuff here, it's more about cool stuff i find.<br>
that's all i'm willing to share really.</p>

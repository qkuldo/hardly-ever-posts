<p>above exchange created through <a href="ravel.neocities.org">ravel by everest pipkin</a><br>
	if you've visited this page's <a href="github.com/qkuldo/hardly-ever-posts">github repo</a>, you may have noticed the above exchange is actually an extended version of the README.md file(essentially the "about page" of code projects). I will make no further comments about this because i don't care.

	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="4">there’s a <strong>bush</strong><br>
	with little feet<br>
	in my little hometown woodland…</p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="8">a bit <em>shy</em><br>
	a bit <em>aloof</em><br>
	and he always want some of that good <strong>berry juice</strong>!</p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="14">it appeared<br>
	in my life<br>
	when my world wasn’t feeling very bright<br>
	when the world’s weight was more than just some big-ass tree<br>
	and crashing down on <strong>me</strong>.</p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="20">when i looked at it with my very own <em>eyes</em><br>
	i just couldn’t help but be filled with <em>delight</em><br>
	at the little 'noxius face<br>
	i opened up my arms to his <em>leafy lair</em><br>
	but he bumped into me and <strong>ran away</strong>…</p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="31">the very next day<br>
	i tried <em>again</em><br>
	in my little hometown woodland<br>
	i got some <em>berries</em><br>
	very <em>nice</em><br>
	and went up to that <strong>very same place</strong><br>
	where i saw, when i looked,<br>
	when/then i was filled with that familiar <em>delight</em><br>
	and reached out my off’ring to the little guy<br>
	and he accepted it with a <em>pretty bright smile</em></p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="38">ever since then<br>
	i’ve been alright<br>
	with my bush in my hometown woodland<br>
	he’s very nice<br>
	he’ll warm up your life<br>
	with the very same look that saved my life</p>
	<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="44">but then again<br>
	i’m just a guy<br>
	with my world just feeling right<br>
	now the world’s weight has gotten numb on me<br>
	with that little friend by my side.</p>

	<p>hello, qkuldo here. i made a little poem a few weeks before for a little bush guy i doodled on my notebook.</p>
	<p><strong>put image here later</strong></p>
	<p><i>this is just a recreation of it in paint. adorable, right?</i></p>
	<p>i've been putting him everywhere now. more of him on my notebook, the blackboard, and my doodle pad. i am most DEFINITELY going to be putting him in my RPG.
	<br>
	i even got a planned role for it in my head! lil creatures who are just trying to defend themselves from danger, and possibly a caretaker character for them.
	<br>
	i will be making the first part in such a way in which u feel bad for hurting them.
	<br>
	well, about the poem. it was fine, but some stuff could be better. 
	<br>
	i focused mostly on rhythm, so i couldn't put the <i>metaphors</i> and <i>onomatopeias</i>.
	<br>
	<i>soooooooo </i>that's all for now. i will probably make another blog sometime in the year (<i>as the name of the site says, HARDLY ever posts...</i>).
	<br>
	after this i will be changing the website a bit, maybe add a favicon(<i>the little icon beside the website's name in the tab list</i>).
	<br>
	farewell, this blog is over now.
